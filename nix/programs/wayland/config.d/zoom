# Zoom Meeting App
# 
# Default for all windows is non-floating.

# zoom has three windows when starting a meeting normally:
#   * the primary window with settings and upcoming meetings
#   * the window for video and controls (the meeting)
#   * a giant popup that escapes the notify system that says audio is connected
# 
# For pop up notification windows that don't use notifications api
for_window [app_id="zoom" title="^zoom$"] border none, floating enable, kill
# For specific Zoom windows
for_window [app_id="zoom" title="^(Zoom|About)$"] border pixel, floating enable
for_window [app_id="zoom" title="Settings"] floating enable, floating_minimum_size 960 x 700
# Open Zoom Meeting windows on a new workspace (a bit hacky)
# for_window [app_id="zoom" title="Zoom Meeting(.*)?"] workspace next_on_output --create, move container to workspace current, floating disable, inhibit_idle open
# just don't float and also inhibit idle
for_window [app_id="zoom" title="Zoom Meeting(.*)?"] floating disable, inhibit_idle open
