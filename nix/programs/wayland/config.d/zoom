# Zoom Meeting App
# 
# Default for all windows is non-floating.

# zoom has three windows when starting a meeting normally:
#   * the primary window with settings and upcoming meetings
#   * the window for video and controls (the meeting)
#   * a giant popup that escapes the notify system that says audio is connected
# 
# For pop up notification windows that don't use notifications api
